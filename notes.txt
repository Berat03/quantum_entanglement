- Treat indiviudal nodes as their own entities w/ their own policy e.c.t.
- Use tensor to speed up the process / computaitonal complexity.

- Concepts to further explore:
    For basic dumbell graph
    - When do we want to wait for swapping and when do we want to swap immediately?

    - Draw out swapping example
    - Explain issues with state space, especially inmultiplexing and if n-step is the best approach?

    - Which version from sutton and barton is best?
