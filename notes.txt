- Qubit memory dependant on nodes

-nprefer not totake an action
- treat destroy as action...
    - still need to consider in the n-step lookahead
    - can we do this with a single action?
    - for the report. don't create partial paths
    - if we have no partial paths, then we can just do single
    - partial path, expected work to finish








    from current state
        look ahead n steps... require simulations
        reward is 0 if nor terminal, instantensous reate is p^2
